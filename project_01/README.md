# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
My capstone project is called Home Maneager. In essence, it is a web application that will help to organize the chores, bills, and shopping needs of a household. This idea arose from my roommates and I frequently arguing about what needs to be done around the apartment, and who should do it. How much money everyone owed for rent and utilities was always an estimate. So I created a spreadsheet to map all expenditure and breakdown who owes what. That's when I thought that the same concept could be applied to other responsibilites. The app will allow users to add items to task lists and shopping lists, as well as post messages to a message board. Users will be able to see what needs to be done, as well who the task is assignted to, to insure accountability. If possible, the app will be able to send email notifications and reminders.

## Features
- User Login
- Email Notification
- Create and edit posts

## What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to set and utilize cookies so posts have a user signatere and the user dashboard is personalized. I will have to learn API for sending email notifications to users. I may also have to learn how to edit and read spreadsheets to incoorporate my bill-paying spreadsheet into my application
